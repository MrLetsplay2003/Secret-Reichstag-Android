# Secret-Reichstag-Android
Secret Reichstag/Secret Hitler App for Android

This is the Android app which can be used to connect to a [Secret Reichstag server](https://github.com/MrLetsplay2003/Secret-Reichstag-Server)

## How to install
Prebuilt .apk files are available under the [releases](https://github.com/MrLetsplay2003/Secret-Reichstag-Android/releases/) section. Make sure the app version you download is compatible with the server version (The official server always uses the newest version).

## Building the app yourself
You can clone this repo or download a zip and open it as an Android Studio project. In Android Studio, you can use `Build > Generate Signed Bundle / APK...` to generate an APK file. Make sure to select `APK`, not `Android App Bundle`.
This will produce an APK file which you can copy to your phone and install.

The Secret Reichstag app currently requires at least Android version 4.4 (KitKat, API level 19), but it is recommended to have at least Android version 7 (Nougat, API level 24) for the best experience

## Connecting to a custom server
The app (v1.3+) supports switching the server and using a different one.

To add a server, you need to enter the `Settings` menu when opening the app. Select `Add Server`, then enter a name for the server, as well as the URL of the server's WebSocket endpoint (starting with `ws://` or `wss://`). After that, you can select your server in the `Select Server` option.
